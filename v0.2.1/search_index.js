The network needs to be of level 1 at most (trees fullfil this condition), and have branch lengths in coalescent units. The test assumes a multinomial distribution for the observed quartet concordance factors (CF), such that information on the number of genes for each four-taxon set (ngenes field) must be present.\n\nFor each four-taxon set, an outlier p-value is obtained by comparing a test statistic (-2log likelihood ratio by default) to a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom (see below for other options).\n\nThe four-taxon sets are then categorized as outliers or not, according to their outlier p-values (outlier if p<0.05). Finally, a one-sided goodness-of-fit test is performed on the frequency of outlier 4-taxon sets to see if there are more outliers than expected. The z-value for this test corresponds to the null hypothesis that 5% outlier p-values are < 0.05 (versus more than 5%):\n\nz = fracmathrmproportionoutliers - 005sqrt005 times 095mathrmnumber4taxonsets\n\nThis z-value corresponds to a test that assumes independent outlier p-values across 4-taxon sets: it makes no correction for dependence.\n\nTo correct for dependence with correction=:simulation, the distribution of z-values is obtained by simulating gene trees under the coalescent along the network (after branch length optimization if optbl=true) using hybrid-Lambda. The z-score is calculated on each simulated data set. Under independence, these z-scores have mean 0 and variance 1. Under dependence, these z-scores still have mean 0, but an inflated variance. This variance σ² is estimated from the simulations, and the corrected p-value is obtained by comparing the original z value to N(0,σ²). When correction=:none, σ is taken to be 1 (independence): not recommended!\n\nThe first version takes a DataFrame where each row corresponds to a given four-taxon set. The data frame is modified by having an additional another column containing the p-values corresponding to each four-taxon set.\nThe second version takes a DataCF object and modifies it by updating the expected concordance factors stored in that object.\n\nNote that net is not modified.\n\narguments\n\noptbl: when false, branch lengths in net are taken as is, and need to be in coalescent units. When optbl=true, branch lengths in net are optimized, to optimize the pseudo log likelihood score as in SNaQ (see here). In both cases, any missing branch length is assigned a value with ultrametrize!, to make the major tree ultrametric, in an attempt to adhere to the current requirements of the hybrid-lambda simulator. Missing branch lengths may arise if they are not identifiable, such as lengths of external branches if there is a single allele per taxon. The network is returned as part of the output.\n\nkeyword arguments\n\nquartetstat: the test statistic used to obtain an outlier p-value for each four-taxon set, which is then compared to a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom to get a p-value. The default is :LRT for the likelihood ratio: 2n_mathrmgenes sum_j=1^3 hat p_j (loghat p_j - log p_j) where p_j is the quartet CF expected from the network, and hat p_j is the quartet CF observed in the data.   Alternatives are :Qlog for the Qlog statistics (Lorenzen, 1995): 2n_mathrmgenes sum_j=1^3 frac(hat p_j - p_j)^2p_j (loghat p_j - log p_j)   and :pearson for Pearon's chi-squared statistic, which behaves poorly when the expected count is low (e.g. less than 5): n_mathrmgenes sum_j=1^3 frac(hat p_j - p_j)^2 p_j\ncorrection=:simulation to correct for dependence across 4-taxon. Use :none to turn off simulations and the correction for dependence.\nseed=1234: master seed to control the seeds for gene tree simulations.\nnsim=1000: number of simulated data sets. Each data set is simulated to have the median number of genes that each 4-taxon sets has data for.\nverbose=false: output from hybrid-Lambda and other output is suppressed. Turn to true to diagnose potential issues.\nkeepfiles=false: files generated by hybrid-Lambda are stored in a temporary folder, whose name starts with jl_ and placed in the current directory.

See Stenz et al 2015 and addendum for the method on trees, from which the acronym TICR was derived: Tree Incongruence Checking with R.\n\nThe tree / network needs to have branch lengths in coalescent units, and must be of level 1. It must be fully resolved, such that the \"major\" quartet is clearly defined, even though branch lengths can be 0.\n\nThe Dirichlet distribution is used to fit the distribution of the observed quartet concordance factors (CF), with a concentration parameter estimated from the data.\n\nThe four-taxon sets are then binned into categories according to their outlier p-values: 0-0.01, 0.01-0.05, 0.05-0.10, and 0.10-1. Finally, a one-sided goodness-of-fit test is performed on these binned frequencies to determine if they depart from an expected 5% p-values being below 0.05 (versus more than 5%), using the default test = :onesided. Alternatively, the option test = :goodness carries out the overall goodness-of-fit chi-square test proposed by Stenz et al. (2015), to test for any kind of departure from the expected frequencies (0.01, 0.04, 0.05, 0.90) across all 4 bins.\n\nThe first version takes a DataFrame where each row corresponds to a given four-taxon set. The data frame is modified by having an additional another column containing the outlier p-values corresponding to each four-taxon set.\nThe second version takes a DataCF object and modifies it by updating the expected concordance factors stored in that object.\nThe last version (which all others call) assumes that the expected concordance factors in the DataCF object are correctly calculated from the test network.\n\narguments\n\noptbl: when false, the loglik field of net is updated but branch lengths are taken as is. When true, a copy of net is used to conduce the test, with updated branch lengths (in coalescent units) and updated loglik. This network is returned.\nquartetstat = :maxCF: test statistic used to obtain an outlier p-value for each four-taxon set. By default, it is the absolute difference between the observed CF and expected CF of the major resolution (which has the largest CF) if quartetstat=:maxCF, as used in Stenz et al. (2015). The other option is quartetstat=:minpval, in which case the absolute difference between the observed CF and expected CF is calculated for all 3 resolutions, leading to 3 (non-independent) p-values. The outlier p-value for a given four-taxon set is taken as the minimum of these 3 p-values. This option can detect all kinds of departure from the network model for a given four-taxon set, but is not recommended because it is very liberal.\ntest = :onesided: the overall goodness-of-fit test performed on binned frequencies of quartet outlier p-values; see above.\n\noutput\n\np-value of the overall goodness-of-fit test\ntest statistic (z value)\na dictionary of the count of p-values in each of the four category\na vector of two test parameters for the Dirichlet distribution:\nvalue of the concentration parameter α\nvalue of the pseudo likelihood (optimized at α)\na vector of outlier p-values, one for each four-taxon set\nnetwork (first and second versions): net with loglik field updated if optbl is false;  copy of net with optimized branch lengths and loglik if optbl is true\n\nreferences\n\nNWM Stenz, B Larget, DA Baum and C Ané (2015).
